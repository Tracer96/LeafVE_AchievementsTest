## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `LeafVE-Achievements-By-Methl` folder into your WoW `Interface/AddOns/` directory so the path looks like:
   ```
   World of Warcraft/
   └── Interface/
       └── AddOns/
           └── LeafVE-Achievements-By-Methl/
               ├── LeafVE_AchievementsTest.toc
               ├── LeafVE_AchievementsTest.lua
               └── data/
                   ├── LeafVE_ConsumablesDB.lua
                   ├── LeafVE_Ach_Kills.lua
                   ├── LeafVE_Ach_Skills.lua
                   ├── LeafVE_Ach_Identity.lua
                   ├── LeafVE_Ach_Reputation.lua
                   └── LeafVE_Ach_Quests.lua
   ```
3. Log in to the game and the addon will load automatically. You should see:
   ```
   [AchTest]: LeafVE Achievement System loaded successfully!
   ```

> **Compatibility:** This addon targets Interface version `11200` (Vanilla / 1.12.x).  
> It uses the Vanilla API (`this`, `arg1`, `event` event handler globals) and is not compatible with modern WoW clients.

## Titles System

Certain achievements unlock a **title** (e.g. *"The Explorer"*, *"Onyxia's Bane"*, *"Grand Marshal"*).

- Open the UI (`/leafach`) and navigate to the **Titles** tab to see all unlocked titles.
- Select a title to make it active — it will appear in orange (or red for Legendary, brown for Guild) before your text when you speak in guild chat.
- Legendary and Guild titles have distinct colour formatting.

---

## Guild Chat Integration

When a title is active the addon hooks `SendChatMessage` to prepend your title to **guild** messages only. Example output:

```
[The Explorer] Naruto: Has anyone done RFC today?
```

The hook is installed 3 seconds after `PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD` to avoid interfering with addon loading. It only modifies `GUILD` channel messages and ignores slash commands and system messages.

---

## SavedVariables

All data is persisted in `LeafVE_AchTest_DB` (defined in the `.toc` file):

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `achievements` | Table of earned achievements per player character. |
| `exploredZones` | Table of discovered zones/subzones per player character. |
| `selectedTitles` | Currently active title per player character. |
| `dungeonProgress` | Per-dungeon boss kill tracking. |
| `raidProgress` | Per-raid boss kill tracking. |
| `progressCounters` | Generic numeric counters (kills, emotes, etc.). |
| `completedQuests` | Completed quest chain steps per player character. |
| `peakGold` | Highest gold amount ever held per player character. |
| `minimapAngle` | Saved minimap button angle (in degrees, 0–360). |

## Contributing / Extending

### Adding a new achievement

1. Call `LeafVE_AchTest:AddAchievement(id, data)` or add an entry directly to the `ACHIEVEMENTS` table in `LeafVE_AchievementsTest.lua`.
2. Fill in the required fields:
   ```lua
   ACHIEVEMENTS["my_ach"] = {
     id       = "my_ach",
     name     = "My Achievement",
     desc     = "Do the thing.",
     category = "Casual",   -- must match an existing category
     points   = 10,
     icon     = "Interface\\Icons\\INV_Misc_QuestionMark",
   }
   ```
3. Award it in the appropriate event handler:
   ```lua
   LeafVE_AchTest:AwardAchievement("my_ach")
   ```

### Adding a new data file

1. Create `data/LeafVE_Ach_MyCategory.lua`.
2. Register achievements with `LeafVE_AchTest:AddAchievement(...)` inside an `ADDON_LOADED` event guard.
3. Add the file path to `LeafVE_AchievementsTest.toc` **before** `LeafVE_AchievementsTest.lua`.

### Debug mode

Enable verbose logging at any time:
```
/achtestdebug
```
All debug messages are prefixed with `[DEBUG]` in red.
